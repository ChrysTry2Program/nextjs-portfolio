Welcome to my **side quest**!

This post is a small creative experiment — something that doesn’t quite fit into my robotics or software projects, but still shows how I think and build things.

Here’s a simple example of inline Markdown formatting:

- **Bold** or _italic_ text
- Inline code like `const x = 42;`
- A numbered list for steps

1. Write something cool
2. Add an image
3. Share your ideas

And now, let’s include the one image allowed per post:

<Image src="/blog/example.jpg" alt="Side Quest" width={800} height={450} />

“Creativity often hides in the things we build just for fun.”

That’s all for this one — see you in the next side quest ✨
